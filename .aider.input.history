+Create a simple HTML5 shooting game. It should have a square that you can move with either WASD or the arrow keys. It should have an arrow that points in the direction of the mouse. If the left click on mouse is hit it should fire a projectile. Create a basic menu system at the start for New Game, Load Game, and Options. Create a basic save game setting that auto saves every 45 seconds the game current position that can be loaded.
